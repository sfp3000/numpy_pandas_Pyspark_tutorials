-Numpy, Pandas, Pyspark for ETL/ELT preparation step by step bonus machine learning
-Hands on and very little theory
-pre-requisites: Python, sql(DB), git, computer, internet, a Database like MySql or Mysql workbench, jupyter notebook
-one on one
-Not a beginner course and must have an introductory course in python and sql.
-course starts easy but at the end we will have optional sections that are professional level and will go very fast.
-This is a course I wish I had before I start my endeavor with ETL testing
- This course is about understanding.
