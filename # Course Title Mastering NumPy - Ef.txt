# **Course Title: Mastering NumPy - Efficient Numerical Computing with Python**  

## **Course Summary:**  
NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundational library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.  

This course is designed for beginners and intermediate Python users who want to leverage NumPy for scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and more. By the end of this course, you will:  
- Understand the fundamentals of NumPy arrays and their advantages over Python lists.  
- Perform fast mathematical and statistical operations on arrays.  
- Manipulate array shapes, dimensions, and indexing techniques.  
- Work with broadcasting, vectorization, and universal functions (ufuncs).  
- Apply NumPy in real-world scenarios like linear algebra, random sampling, and data processing.
